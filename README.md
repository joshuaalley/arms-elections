Forthcoming at *The Journal of Politics*. 

The United States makes more arms deals with autocracies during election years. 
U.S. leaders sell arms to autocrats to bolster their electoral prospects by claiming credit for providing jobs and increasing defense contracting.
Autocratic arms recipients have the political flexibility to order arms around elections and increase their security by taking arms. 
Three major pieces of evidence support this argument.  
First, I detail electoral cycles in arms deals between the United States and autocracies. 
I then show that arms deals increase defense contract awards in swing states.
Finally, I unpack the process by showing how deal timing shifts after regime change, that U.S. allies drive most of the autocratic arms deals cycle and that the same platforms that move in arms deals increase swing state contracts.  
The argument and results detail an electoral driver of U.S. security cooperation with autocrats.
